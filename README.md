Iridium Message Style for Adium
===============================

This is my copy of the [Iridium Message
Style](http://adiumxtras.com/index.php?a=xtras&xtra_id=8262) for
[Adium](http://adium.im). It's best suited for using Adium as an IRC
client.

The original sources were in Mercurial
[here](https://bitbucket.org/xnyhps/iridium/overview).
